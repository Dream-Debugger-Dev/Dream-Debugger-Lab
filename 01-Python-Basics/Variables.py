#A variable is a name to a memory location in a program
#Same like in math, find the value of X 🥶, so X value can be anything after solving problem right so X value is veriable depends on Questions, that means value is changeable and changeable value is called variable
#For variable name we can use a single latter also a word , or more than 1 word but woerd should not be seperated by space instead we can use _ or -
#Variable is memory location , we use variable for store value with name in momory

#Some Veriables and their values 

name = "Dream Debugger"
age = 24
tenth_percentage = 53.45

#We can also store variable in another variable 

newname = name

#Now we can print the value of the variables like this 👇

print(name) #output Dream Debugger
print(age) #output 24
print(tenth_percentage) #output 53.45

#we can also print all in once 

print(name, age, tenth_percentage) #output Dream debugger 24 53.45

#We can also print variable value with other sentence

print("My name is", name)
print("My age is", name)

#if we will print variable with variable is will print 1st variable value

print(newname) #it will print name variable value which is Dream Debugger
