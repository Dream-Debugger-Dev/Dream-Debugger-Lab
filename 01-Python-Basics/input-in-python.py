#Input in Python 
#input() statement is used to accept value from the keyboard (using the keyboard) from the user

#input("Enter your name:") #this is how we can use input in python along with text.

name = input("Enter your name:") #we can aslo store the input assigning variable like also we can take multiple inputs from user 👇
age = input("Enter your age:") # input always by default String, untill you tell input know waht data typoe you want
mark = float(input("Enter your marks:")) # this is how you can difine the data type for input



print("Welcome", name, ) #and then print that variable vaelue what ever user give input along with Welcome message
print("your age ",age,type(age)) 
print("your marks", mark,type(mark))
# meaning if I run this code first program will ask me for input along with mesage Entery your name:
# after eentering value from keyboard 
#it will print Welcome and the value that I entered in first ask
