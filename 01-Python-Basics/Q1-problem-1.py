#Q1. write a python program to print 2 variables sum
a = 5
b = 10  
sum = a + b # sum of two variables
diff = b - a # difference of two variables
multi = a * b # product of two variables
divide = b / a # division of two variables
print("The sum of", a, "and", b, "is:", sum) # print sum
print("The difference of", a, "and", b, "is:", diff) # print difference
print("The product of", a, "and", b, "is:", multi) # print product
print("The division of", a, "and", b, "is:", divide) # print division
