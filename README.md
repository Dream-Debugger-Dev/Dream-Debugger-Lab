# 🧪 Dream Debugger Lab

> **The Workbench.** Daily practice, LeetCode solutions, and raw code experiments.

This repository is where I get my hands dirty. While my **[Roadmap Repo](../Dream-Debugger-Roadmap)** tracks *what* I learn, this repo contains the actual code I write to learn it.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
I organize my practice code by topic:

* **`📂 /01-Python-Basics`** - Loops, Functions, OOP, and syntax practice.
* **`📂 /02-LeetCode`** - Data Structures & Algorithms solutions.
* **`📂 /03-Mini-Scripts`** - Small automation tools and random experiments.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**This is a learning playground.**
Expect to see:
* Code that breaks.
* Comments explaining simple concepts (for my own memory).
* "Spaghetti code" that I will refactor later.

*Real, polished projects will be uploaded to their own separate repositories.*
